Hello and welcome to the HackStack Technologies repository.

In this repository there are a few different folders that shouldn't be altered unless approved.
1. Production Folder
    This Folder mimics the filesystem of the server used to host the services. 
    The File directory is set up the same way so when programming different pages for the web interface, 
    file paths can be set to what they will be on the server.
